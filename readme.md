## Gmail -> Snail Mail

This project takes emails in a certain gmail inbox, will eventually search for google wallet cash to validate the transaction, then send a request to lob by parsing out the address, your address (from an original setup email), and then goes through the body of the message to format it professionally before it mails it then emails you in confirmation.

Enjoy!

    Dear Ms. Nessen:

    I want to thank you for taking the time to interview me yesterday for the
    position of assistant director of the Dayton Sumner Memorial Art Museum.
    You, Mr. Dawson, and Dr. Acquino exuded warmth, and I know we could all
    have an excellent working relationship.

    As I further studied the job description for the position, I grew even more
    confident that I could take the museum to new heights of success. With the
    resources I've gathered, I am ready to hit the ground running with
    grant-writing. The 15 percent bonus for grants brought in is an excellent
    incentive, and I would devote a significant portion of my time to
    this important venture. I also have a number of great ideas for community
    and media relations and am excited by your interest in bringing more
    schoolchildren to the museum.


    As I mentioned when we met, I would like to use my fine arts degree and
    journalism minor to enhance the museum's
    identity while at the same time meeting the needs and expectations of the
    community. I believe I can make a
    significant contribution to the fundraising effort, and I am particularly
    interested in exploring a corporate donor
    program.

    I am convinced I could bring a new degree of organization to the museum,
    including sinking my teeth into making the
    workspace far less chaotic and far more functional. More importantly, I'd
    like to get communications on track so that
    newsletters and invitations are sent out on a timely basis. I have some
    ideas for making the newsletter more userfriendly.
    I feel it is extremely important to maintain close communication between
    the board and director, and I am
    committed to doing so.
    Ms. Nessen, I thank you again for considering me for this position. I look
    forward to the possibility of working with you.

    Sincerely,
    John Oakley A Thank
